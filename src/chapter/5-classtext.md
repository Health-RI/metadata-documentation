## Class Structure 
The Health-RI metadata schema builds on DCAT-AP 3.0, which defines a set of classes and properties for describing datasets, services, and related resources. To make the model easier to apply across catalogues while maintaining interoperability, the schema organizes its structure around two types of classes: **Main Classes** and **Supportive Classes**.

- **Main Classes** – the core entities of the catalogue.
- **Supportive Classes** – contextual entities that provide detail to the main classes.

Main classes in this structure:
- **Catalog**
- **Dataset**
- **Data Service**
- **Dataset Series**
- **Distribution**

Supportive classes in this structure:
- **Agent**
- **Kind**
- **Attribution**
- **Checksum**
- **Identifier**
- **Period of time**
- **Relationship**
- **Quality certificate**
- **Activity**
- **CSVW (Variables)**

The main classes and supportive classes together form the Health-RI Core metadata schema. 

**Please take into consideration**:
- Certain properties (e.g. `dct:publisher`, `dct:creator`, `dcat:contactPoint`) in several of the main classes refer to supportive classes (e.g. [`foaf:Agent`](#agent), [`vcard:Kind`](#kind)). These properties link to instances of the relevant supportive classes. For example, `dct:publisher` and `dct:creator` link to [`foaf:Agent`](#agent) resources that can describe different entities (e.g. an organisation and a person).

- It is possible that not all main classes of the metadata schema are necessary to describe your data or the structure of your data. For example, [DataService](#data-service) or [DatasetSeries](#dataset-series) might not apply to all datasets described or onboarded in the National Health Data Catalogue.

- The power of [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/) is that it is flexible in use, giving a data holder the ability to reflect the structure of their data by using the different classes.

- We aim to collect mapping examples from different data sources [here](https://health-ri.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSD/folder/736985095). Currently, this collection contains only mapping examples for v1.

## Usage Notes on Schema / Mapping
Supportive classes are included because they serve as ranges for properties of the main classes. They provide additional information about the main classes, which are the core entities in the catalogue. Both groups of classes contain **mandatory properties** for conformance and **recommended properties** for richer metadata. 

This separation helps modularize metadata and makes it easier to reuse supportive elements across multiple datasets or services. To apply the schema:
- Start with main classes -> Identify the datasets, services, and distributions you need to describe.
- Link supportive classes –> Use them wherever the schema specifies a property range (e.g., publisher → Agent).
- Always fill mandatory properties –> Ensure your metadata is valid and interoperable.
- Check controlled vocabulary requirements -> For each property, consult [Controlled Vocabularies](#controlled-vocabularies) to determine whether a MUST, AT LEAST 1, or MAY requirement applies, as controlled vocabularies ensure consistent and interoperable values.
- Add recommended properties where possible –> Improve FAIRness and increase the overall maturity of your metadata.
- Reuse supportive entities –> E.g. if the same Agent or Identifier appears in multiple records, reference it rather than duplicating it.

The following sections describe each class in detail, including its role in the schema, its mandatory and recommended properties, and examples of how to populate them.

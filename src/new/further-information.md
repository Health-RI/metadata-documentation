## Model extension

This is a Health-RI core metadata schema, which means it is designed to be “minimal” and cover the basic metadata elements of catalogue resources. If you come from a specific working group or domain and see some of the important elements from your domain should be represented in the metadata, you could build an extension (or so-called petal) of this model for your domain's specific needs. For more information on this, please check out the [process description for domain-specific metadata](https://health-ri.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSD/pages/545783826/Domain-specific+metadata+schema+development).

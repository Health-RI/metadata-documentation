# Permanent Urls # {#permanent-urls}

## Metadata Resources
To support long-term FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) access to Health-RI Metadata Schema resources, we provide persistent URLs using the [W3ID](https://w3id.org/) system. These permanent identifiers improve the **findability** and **accessibility** of the related artifacts.
The following **W3ID redirects** are available for Health-RI metadata:

## Health-RI Metadata

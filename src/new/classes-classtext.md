Health-RI’s schema is designed to support FAIR data principles—making health data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. To achieve this, the schema organizes its structure around two types of classes: **Main Classes** and **Supportive Classes**.

**Main Classes** represent the core entities of the data catalog. These include the Catalog, Dataset, Data Service, Dataset Series, and Distribution. They define the essential components of the data: what data exists, how it’s grouped, and how it can be accessed.

**Supportive Classes** provide additional context and metadata that enrich and clarify the main entities. These include elements like Agent, Identifier, Period of Time, Checksum, and Quality Certificate. They enhance discoverability, traceability, and trustworthiness of the data.

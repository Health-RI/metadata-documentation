# Classes # {#classes-classtext} 
Health-RIâ€™s schema is designed to support FAIR data principles in biomedical research. Its **main classes** focus on the core entities that describe and deliver data, while **supporting classes** enrich those entities with context, provenance, and technical details.

- **Main classes** define the core entities that describe the data and how it is delivered. Think: what the data is and who allows users access it.
- **Supporting classes** provide contextual, technical, and provenance-related information. Think: who created it, how it's validated, and how it's linked to other resources.

This separation helps modularize metadata and makes it easier to reuse supporting elements across multiple datasets or services.

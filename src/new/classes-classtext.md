# Classes # {#classes-classtext} 
Health-RIâ€™s schema is designed to support FAIR data principles in biomedical research. Its **main classes** focus on the core entities that describe and deliver data, while **supporting classes** enrich those entities with context, provenance, and technical details.

- **Main classes** = What the data is and how it's delivered.
- **Supporting classes** = Who made it, how it's validated, and how it's connected.

This separation helps modularize metadata and makes it easier to reuse supporting elements across multiple datasets or services.

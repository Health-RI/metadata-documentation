      <td>A Dataset Series is a collection of similar datasets that are somehow interrelated but published separately. An example is consecutive datasets split by year and/or datasets separated by location. Instead of being made available in a single dataset, the individual (e.g. yearly) datasets are linked together with the Dataset Series class.</td>

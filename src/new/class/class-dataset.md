      <td>When focusing on health data, a dataset typically contains structured information gathered from a study or research project related to health topics. This might include clinical trial results, public health statistics, patient records, survey data, etc. <br> 
      How the data in a dataset can be accessed is defined in the [Distribution](linkto:distribution), which usually points to the actual data files available for access or download. Datasets are often included in a catalog, which organizes and provides metadata about multiple datasets, making them easier to find and use. The term 'agent' refers to any entity responsible for creating, maintaining, or distributing the dataset.</td>

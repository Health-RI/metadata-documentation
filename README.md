<img src="src/new/images/HRI_Logo.png" alt="" width="" height="" title="">

## Specification
This branch contains the 2nd version of the Health-RI core and generic health metadata schema for the National Health Data Catalogue, detailing the classes and entities involved and offering usage notes for developers. The documentation aims at a technical audience tasked with implementing the metadata schema and stakeholders interested in a detailed understanding of the core metadata schema.

This specification of version 2.0 of Health-RI core metadata schema is found at [**technical details**](https://health-ri.github.io/metadata-documentation/). 

## Documentation
It addresses the schema's design and application but excludes discussion on the National Health Data Catalogue and its [onboarding process](https://health-ri.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSD/pages/279150593/Metadata+onboarding+on+the+National+Catalogue). **Please note that we are currently still working on the implementation of the new schema into the frontend of the National Health Data Catalogue.**

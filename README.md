This branch contains the 2nd version of the Health-RI core and generic health metadata schema for the National Health Data Catalogue, detailing the classes and entities involved and offering usage notes for developers. The documentation aims at a technical audience tasked with implementing the metadata schema and stakeholders interested in a detailed understanding of the core metadata schema. This specification of version 2.0 of Health-RI core metadata schema is found at [**technical details**](https://reiniergr.github.io/metadata-vocabulary/).

##  Catalogue Schema and Specification
It addresses the schema's design and application but excludes discussion on the National Health Data Catalogue and its [onboarding process](https://health-ri.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSD/pages/279150593/Metadata+onboarding+on+the+National+Catalogue)). 

For whom needs more introduction and general instructions you can also visit Confluence for general information about the [metadata schema](https://health-ri.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSD/pages/279281676/4A+Metadata+mapping), [metadata mapping](https://health-ri.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSD/pages/290291734/Mapping+tutorial),  and visual aid for [elements of the metadata schema](https://health-ri.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSD/pages/279281676/4A+Metadata+mapping#%F0%9F%A7%A9-What-are-the-elements-of-the-Health-RI-core-metadata-schema%3F) or [relations between classes](https://health-ri.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSD/pages/279281676/4A+Metadata+mapping#Overview-of-all-core-Health-RI-classes-and-relations-between-classes). **Please note that we are currently still working on the implementation of the new schema into the frontend of the National Health Data Catalogue.**
